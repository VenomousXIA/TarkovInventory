# Unreal Engine 5 Game Feature: Space-Based Inventory System

## Quick Intro

Game development is a hobby of mine. I choose game features and decide to implement them using unreal engine.
This is my way of learning by trying to implement my knowledge into real projects and what's better than implementing
features from popular and successful games?

### Chosen game for this feature: Escape From Tarkov. Mainly due to its **complexity and details**
